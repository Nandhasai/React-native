Github is popular not only for hosting repositories but also because itâ€™s a great place to host your websites. Best thing about hosting your website on Github? Itâ€™s free! Cool eh?

In this article, Iâ€™ll show you how to easily publish a create-react-app project on Github.
Without further ado, letâ€™s get started.

Note: I assume you have basic knowledge on git and Github.

1. Create a Github repository
First thing you have to do is to create an empty repository on Github. It could have any name you want.

2. The rest happens on the command line
Run npm run build on your create-react-app project.
A build folder will be created inside your project.
Next up, go to package.json and paste this line of code:
"homepage": "http://username.github.io/myapp" .
Replace username with your own Github username and myapp with the name of the repository that youâ€™ve just created earlier.

package.json
3. Add these lines of code to your package.json:
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
and then run npm install --save-dev gh-pages .

You should see these lines of code added to your package.json: "devDependencies": {
"gh-pages": "^1.1.0"
}


package.json
4. Lastly, run npm run deploy .

Thatâ€™s it! Go to the url youâ€™ve provided on the homepage
(http://username.github.io/myapp ) and you should see your webisteâ€” up and running!

Note: If youâ€™re having an error, initialize your project with git (if you havenâ€™t) then run git remote add origin git://url-here (replace git://url-here with the git url of the repository youâ€™ve created at the first step).
Run npm run deploy again and you should be good! ðŸ˜„
